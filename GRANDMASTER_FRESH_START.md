# Grandmaster Roadmap (Fresh Start)

Since you are starting fresh with `train_fast.py`, here is the complete plan to reach huge strength.

## Phase 1: Massive Data Generation (The Long Grind)
The key to Grandmaster strength is **DATA**. 
The new `train_fast.py` is configured to generate **2.5 Million positions** at **Depth 12**.

1. **Start Generation**:
   Run this command and let it run overnight (or for many hours):
   ```bash
   python3 train_fast.py
   ```
   *Note: It has a "Resume" feature. If you stop it or it crashes, just run it again and it will continue from where it left off.*

2. **Monitor**: 
   It will print progress like `Progress: 150000/2500000`. 

## Phase 2: Training (Automatic)
Once generation hits 2.5M positions, the script will **automatically** start training the NNUE model for 35 epochs.
- It uses the GPU if available.
- It saves the best model to `fluxfish.nnue`.

## Phase 3: Export & Play
After the script finishes successfully:
1. **Export**:
   ```bash
   python3 export_model.py
   ```
2. **Setup C++ Engine**:
   Make sure you have compiled the C++ engine:
   ```bash
   cd cpp
   make
   ```
3. **Move weights**:
   The `fluxfish.bin` file generated by step 1 needs to be in the folder where the engine runs (usually `cpp/`).

## Phase 4: Verification
Test your new engine against Stockfish Level 8 or other engines.
- If it plays strong moves: **Success**.
- If it plays random moves: Check if `fluxfish.bin` was loaded correctly.
